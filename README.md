## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Lyrics Finder is a Python based Script which searches for Lyrics on Genius. It supports all song language, as long as it's listed on Genius. If you don't know the song title, you can search the song by using its lyrics.

Search for lyrics of your favorite songs! XD!
And also I guess this is the only working and with least limitations lyrics finder on Github.

# BONUS: If you forgot song name and remembered any line of it, then you might try with it too. Sometimes it works, try with artist name too, if only a line doesn't works.

If wanted to have any change you are most Welcome here.....
